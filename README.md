# Game Counter
--------

Today, there are games but arent enough game counters. We don't know what we have played and how many times have we played. Of course there are gem vendors like Steam who counts each and every minute but what if I want to play EA Games and so. Fear not, Game Counter is just for you. This is a platform independent (JAVA) application which is used to track the name of the games, the scores in each of the game and the minutes played for each of those game. <br />
Game Counter is a counter application made from Java. This application provides an interface to add your name the first time then add game name, score and minutes played unlimited times until quit is written. The output is then resulted in swing application in a form style. The output is also loaded in HTML file and is loaded automatically. <br />
This has the potential to be a real production application. It can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. As the codebase is also on JAVA, it would be flexible too. Everybody is welcome!!<br /> <br />
